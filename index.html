    <p>I am 24 years old and new to coding. I consider myself an easy person to get along with, and I'm eager to learn. </p>
    <h2 id="my start">How I got my start</h2>
    <p>I first became interested in coding after working with some of my current team members, who are on the tech team. It seems like such an interesting skill to have, communicating with computers to bring websites to life. 
        I found out that obsorbing this skill would do good things for me, so I thought I'd give it a try. 
    </p>
    <p>Grand Circus caught my attention when they had an article up on my company's news page. It seemed like the perfect opportunity for me. 
        Especially because Grand Circus offers this after-hours program, so I can still work full time while doing this. </p>
